### Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

## Objective:
  Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is benign (B) or malignant (M) using a dataset of clinical variables.

## Dataset Details:
- Total Samples: 569
- Features: 20 clinical variables
- Labels: B (Benign), M (Malignant)

## Requirements:
- Use Spark MLLib for model development: Spark MLLib
- Select two machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, etc.) to train and evaluate your models.
- Compare the performance of the two models based on evaluation metrics.

## Deliverables (Due by 11:59 PM on May 20):
- Code
- README File
- Report containing:
  Justification for the chosen algorithms
  Description of your training procedure
  Data splits
  Testing results

## Evaluation using:
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall
- Accuracy (% correct predictions)
- Comparison and analysis of the two algorithms

## Discussion on:
- Limitations of your approach
- Suggestions for future improvements
